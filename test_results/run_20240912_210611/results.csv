0.4,What are some of the differences between playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive?,True,"The biggest issue with playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) is the controls, which are not as responsive as on the HTC Vive. The WMR controllers also don't let you travel as quickly as on the Vive. However, there is an option in the VR settings that lets you adjust the speed of movement. Tracking on WMR is also precise, but occasionally a controller may lose its place if moved too far out of view of the sensors on the headset. The display in the HP WMR headset has a higher resolution than the Vive, providing a clearer picture. The setup for WMR is easier and quicker than for the Vive. In terms of price, WMR bundles start at about $400, while the Vive system costs about $600.","Playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive has several differences:

- **Tracking**:Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) uses inside-out tracking,which means it uses sensors on the headset to track the player's movements without external sensors. HTC Vive uses outside-in tracking,requiring base stations to track the player's movements.
- **Performance**:WMR headsets generally have less powerful hardware than HTC Vive,which can lead to lower performance and frame rates in VR games like Fallout 4.
- **Comfort**:WMR headsets are designed to be more comfortable for extended use with a flip-up visor and a more natural fit. HTC Vive headsets can be bulkier and may be less comfortable for some users.
- **Setup**:WMR requires less setup as it doesn't need external sensors. HTC Vive requires the setup of base stations,which can take more time and space.
- **Compatibility**:WMR is compatible with a wider range of PCs,including those with less powerful hardware,while HTC Vive requires a more robust PC to run VR games smoothly.

These differences can affect the overall VR experience for Fallout 4,with WMR potentially offering a more accessible and convenient experience,but with potentially lower performance,while HTC Vive might offer a more immersive and high-performance experience.",False,30,"The input response does not match the standard answer. While it provides a comparison of tracking,performance,comfort,setup,and compatibility between Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive,it does not address the specific issue of controls and movement responsiveness mentioned in the standard answer. The standard answer focuses on the responsiveness of controls and the speed of movement,which are not covered in the input response.",输入的回复没有符合标准答案。虽然它提供了Windows混合现实和HTC Vive在追踪、性能、舒适度、设置和兼容性方面的比较，但它没有涉及到标准答案中提到的具体控制响应速度问题。标准答案侧重于控制的响应速度和移动速度，而这些在输入回复中没有涉及。

In terms of price, WMR bundles start at about $400, while the Vive system costs about $600.","Playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive have several differences:

- **Tracking**:Windows Mixed Reality uses inside-out tracking,which means the headset itself tracks your movements without external sensors. HTC Vive uses outside-in tracking,requiring base stations to be placed around the play area to track your movements.
- **Performance**:Generally,HTC Vive offers better performance with higher frame rates and lower latency compared to Windows Mixed Reality,which can result in a smoother experience.
- **Comfort**:Some users may find Windows Mixed Reality headsets more comfortable due to their lighter weight and less bulky design. HTC Vive headsets are heavier and may be more noticeable over extended periods.
- **Setup**:Windows Mixed Reality is easier to set up as it doesn't require additional hardware like base stations. HTC Vive requires the installation of base stations and a more complex setup process.
- **Compatibility**:Some VR games and applications may have better compatibility with one platform over the other,which can affect the overall experience.",False,20,"The input response does not match the standard answer.

The WMR controllers also don't let you travel as quickly as on the Vive. However, there is an option in the VR settings that lets you adjust the speed of movement. Tracking on WMR is also precise, but occasionally a controller may lose its place if moved too far out of view of the sensors on the headset. The display in the HP WMR headset has a higher resolution than the Vive, providing a clearer picture. The setup for WMR is easier and quicker than for the Vive. In terms of price, WMR bundles start at about $400, while the Vive system costs about $600.","Playing Fallout 4 VR on Windows Mixed Reality and HTC Vive have several differences:

- **Tracking**:Windows Mixed Reality uses inside-out tracking,which means the headset itself tracks your movements without external sensors. HTC Vive uses outside-in tracking,requiring base stations to track your movements. This can affect the accuracy and range of tracking.
- **Performance**:The performance can vary between the two platforms. Windows Mixed Reality headsets generally have less powerful hardware,which might result in lower frame rates compared to the HTC Vive.
- **Comfort**:Some users might find Windows Mixed Reality headsets more comfortable due to their lighter weight and lack of wires,while others might prefer the more immersive experience of the HTC Vive with its tethered setup.
- **Accessibility**:Windows Mixed Reality is more accessible as it requires less setup and can be used with a wider range of PCs. HTC Vive requires a more powerful PC and additional hardware setup.
- **Content**:The available content for each platform can vary,with some VR experiences being exclusive to one platform or the other.",False,20,"The input response does not match the standard answer.
